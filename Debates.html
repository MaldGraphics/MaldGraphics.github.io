<p><i>Why supporting High school and University level Debate is a Worthwhile Project? </i></p>
<p><b>#1.Debates help you think critically</b></p>
<p>Most people tend to make arbitary statements when in any disagreement, which results in an argument,<br>
rather than a logical discussion. This logical discussion is the debate.<br>
Debating requires thinking critically about ideas of others as well as your point of view.This includes questioning<br>
the arguments with the help of facts skepticism based on evidence. the ability to think critically will help you<br>
make your own decisions in every aspect of your life and let you stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p><b>#2. Debates improve your speakng skills</b></p>
<p>No matter how good of a thinker you are and how much you know about a particular subject,<br>
none of it will be of any value if you can’t articulate your thoughts and convert them into meaningful words<br>
and express them with impressive presentational skills. Debating requires you to do all these things and more,<br>
sometimes with former preparation while other times instantaneously. A great debater must almost always be<br>
an articulate and eloquent speaker.</p>
<p><b>#3. Debates make you more knowledgeable</b></p>
<p>A person with a habit of healthy debating will always be a knowledgeable person with a grasp of ideas about<br>
varied subjects. Debating requires you to take references and information from a range of different topics,<br>
to back your argument. With knowledge comes intellect and intellect is a highly valued and prized quality to have<br>
in the world we live in today. Debates are a great way to both expand your knowledge base as well as to put your knowledge<br>
to good use.</p>
<p><b>#4. Debates are a tool to resolve conflicts</b></p>
<p>Debates have been a powerful method to resolve conflicts throughout history.<br>
The courtroom debate is a perfect example of the importance of debates in solving conflicts. The conclusions derived from a good debate<br>
are an effective way of reaching a consensus. The debating society of London is an infamous movement during the Age of Enlightenment<br>
where a spectrum of topics and issues were discussed upon.</p>
<p><b>#5.Debates are means of idea extension</b></p>
<p>Since debates are normally performed in a public setting, they are prominent means of sharing your ideas with others.<br>
Not only that, through debates, you get the chance to elaborate your ideas and persuade your listeners<br>
towards your argument. The US Presidential debates are targeted at undecided rational voters where the candidates express their ideologies<br>
and plan to the general public.</p>
<p><b>#6.Debates improve your research skills.</b></p>
<p>Debates require a lot of preparation. To be a great debater on a particular topic, you need to deliver coherent arguments.<br>
For that, you must first understand as much as you can about that particular topic as well as related topics.<br>
You need to dig into the vast pool of information available on books, researches, <br>
the physical world, and the internet. To be able to extract relevant and crucial information is as challenging of a task as is necessary.<br>
So, debates help you develop good research skills.</p>
<p><b>#7.Debates make you time conscious</b></p>
<p>Most debates take place in a limited time frame. Even in informal debates,<br>
everyone has a certain and limited time to express themselves. As a result, debates give you a better sense of time and prioritize<br>
your ideas and what you say. It helps you to develop the habit of talking just what’s necessary, <br>
not too little nor too much.</p>
<p><b>#8.Debates help you construct meaning</b></p>
<p>Meaning is something that every matured person strives for in every situation of his/her life.<br>
Debating will help you use your logical arguments to see things as they are and not how they seem to be. Consequently, you will be able to construct meaning<br>
even from complex situations. The skills obtained from debates help you understand your mind and emotions better. Self-debate is in fact not very different from regular debates.</p>
<p><b>#9.Debates will broaden your view</b></p>
<p>Something that many people fail to understand about debates is that it is a two-way thing. Debates are not just mere speeches where arguments are presented<br>
and counter-arguments are attached upon. Debates are a means of understanding the different perspectives<br>
that others can have about the same topic and how those perspectives are made. This helps to develop the capacity<br>
to view the same thing from varied perspectives and sometimes, a better perspective.</p>
<p><b>#10.Debates accelerate your personal growth</b></p>
<p>Apart from the already mentioned benefits that a person can get from debates, debates are very helpful in your personal growth in many ways.<br>
Debates are done in social settings, and hence, they are important to help build better communicational skills and a perfect social circle. When you are exposed<br>
 to a mosaic of topics where you discuss upon, it also lets you decide on what interests you the most and it can even guide your career choices.</p>
