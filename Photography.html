        <h4>1.	Photography affords immortality</h4>
        <p>Don’t believe it? Look at all the old photographs your mom or grandmother had around. I personally have a picture in my china cabinet of a newly married couple in 1911, and I have no idea who it is. (No, Cousin Ann, I don’t care to know.) I mean, it has their names on the back, but I’m not quite sure just where in the family tree they belong. I just think it’s cool. They looked so stiff and formal back then! It sure is different than how we take such natural pictures today. I personally will be immortalized laughing or smiling in many pictures.
	
        </p>
        <h4>2.	Photography is a wonderful stress reliever</h4>
        <p>I mean, really, how much can you concentrate on that all-consuming problem when you turn your focus instead to the petals of a flower, the wings of a butterfly, the graceful curves of a majestic mountain, or the dimples of a smiling baby?

            Go ahead. Take your blood pressure before and after spending just 30 minutes focusing on getting that perfect picture. You’ll be amazed at the difference.
            
            Then, for better overall health, just rinse and repeat often. It’s okay. I promise the problem won’t go away. It’ll still be there when you’re ready to start worrying again.
            
            </p>
            <h4>3.	Photography inspires your imagination</h4>
            <p>My sister is a professional photographer and her creativity while taking photographs of the kids is what moved her (slowly) toward a career as a photographer. She loves finding and replicating such creative poses as a newborn in a net seemingly hanging from the sky. She also loves taking a couple and creating romantic ways for the shared love to be shown.

                It has inspired my own creativity, as I help her come up with new ideas. For instance, one day I was walking on a road with plenty of random cracks in it. The sun was behind me casting my shadow forward. We were talking on the phone about how to capture this one particular couple and the strength of their union and I mentioned the cracks all around them (symbolizing life in general). However, when it came to their shadows, they were solid. In this way it showed the strength of the union as well as how life couldn’t “crack” them.
                </p>
                <h4>4.	Photography as a career is possible for anyone with a true passion for it</h4>
                <p>There are people who make a living being a photographer. Imagine, if you will, that every picture you’ve ever seen, whether it’s on a billboard, in a magazine, or on TV, was snapped by someone. There are schools, classes, books, and websites where you could learn much more than I could ever tell you. Remember, you have your whole life in front of you. Why not aim for a part-time career on the side?</p>
                <h4>5.	Photography is a wonderful,safe, and natural self-esteem booster</h4>
                <p>My 14 year-old loves the feeling of pride she gets when she takes pictures of her friends and they turn out good. When she downloads and sees them on the computer she’s in seventh heaven. And, of course, she loves sharing them with her friends.
	
                </p>
                <h4>6.	Photography lets you see things that you amy never notice otherwise</h4>
                <p>When I look at something I can’t possibly take in every aspect that is within my vision. For instance, a beautiful sunset only lasts so long and I may not notice all aspects of how the colors play on the water (I live in a beach town). The look of the sand (such a simple thing) changes as the sun lowers. All of these aspects are much more evident in a picture, and I can concentrate on the overall view while knowing that the individual components will not be lost forever.</p>
                <h4>7.	Photography preserves new and old memories</h4>
                <p>Think of the wife or husband who has lost a spouse. Or the child who lost a parent. With pictures not only can they have no fear of forgetting their loved one’s face but can remember exactly what was going on when that picture was snapped, cementing the memory forever.</p>

                <h2>PHYSICAL IMPORTANCES OF HIKING</h2><hr>
                <p>I’m going to start off by sharing some of the benefits of hiking to your physical health. While some of the physical benefits may be obvious – like weight loss – hiking has some surprising perks.</p>
                <h4>HIKING IS GOOD FOR THE HEART</h4>
                <p>Hiking is great for cardiovascular health. Even light hiking can raise the heart rate to a moderate level which helps improve aerobic fitness and endurance. Over time, your body adjusts to new fitness levels and you can hike longer, faster, and harder without feeling as fatigued or out of breath.

                    Hiking can also improve markers associated with cardiovascular health like blood pressure, blood sugar levels, and cholesterol. Studies have shown that going on regular moderate hikes can significantly reduce hypertension, improve glucose tolerance, and decrease ‘bad’ cholesterol levels over time.
                    
                    So if cardiovascular health is a concern for you, hiking can be a great way to improve your heart health!
                    
                    Hiking is a fantastic way to build strength, improve fitness, and cultivate mental health. Learn more about the physical and mental benefits of hiking.

                    <h4>HIKING IMPROVES BALANCE</h4>
                    <p>I’ll start by sharing that balance hasn’t always been my strong suit, and crossing streams and boulder fields can give me anxiety. That’s one reason I love hiking with trekking poles. However, every time I challenge myself on that kind of terrain, I notice my balance improving, and by the end of summer, I’m much better at trusting my balance. But it isn’t just practice that makes perfect here. There is actually science behind this.

                        As you walk along a trail, your leg and core muscles are constantly engaging and contracting to provide stability and balance over uneven terrain. As these core stabilizing muscles strengthen over time, balance improves.
                        
                        But it’s not just stabilizing muscles that improve balance. Hiking also helps increase proprioception, which is the mind’s awareness of the position and movement of the body in relation to its surroundings. As you hike, the brain is processing every rock and root and gauging what it will take to step over obstacles. With practice, the brain becomes more adept at judging these obstacles, and as a result, balance improves.
                        
                        As we get older, it’s really important to keep working on balance in order to prevent falls. Hiking is a fun way to improve balance while spending time in the outdoors.
                        
                        Hiking is a fantastic way to build strength, improve fitness, and cultivate mental health. Learn more about the physical and mental benefits of hiking.

                        <h4>HIKING HELPS BUILD MUSCLE	</h4>
                        <p>As we touched on above, one benefits of hiking is it helps build stabilizing muscles in the legs and core to improve balance. But hiking also strengthens other muscles of the body including the arms and back. In fact, hiking is great exercise for almost every major muscle group in the body! Walking uphill engages the glutes, quads, hamstrings, and calves while hiking downhill engages the ankles, hips, and core.

                            The arm and back muscles can be strengthened while hiking through the use of trekking poles or carrying a moderate to heavy pack. (Learn how to choose a good hiking pack here)
                            
                            So if going to the gym isn’t your idea of fun, give hiking a try! It’s a great workout for the whole body and as we’ll talk about below, it’s a great way to calm the mind and release stress too.

                                HIKING HELPS WITH WEIGHT LOSS
                                </h4>
                                <p>While this might not be everyone’s goal, if you do want to lose weight, hiking is a great way to do it. I lost nearly 40 pounds hiking and had a blast doing it (ok it wasn’t all fun, but it was worlds better than the gym).

                                    The number of calories burned during a hike depends on a lot of factors like weight, gender, and aerobic intensity, but if you’re just starting out, even light hiking can result in gradual weight loss.
                                    
                                    The recommendation for physical activity for adults is at least 150 minutes (2.5 hours) per week. If your goal is weight loss, try starting out with three 50 minute hikes per week on a local trail.
                                    
                                    
                                    
                                    I first started hiking back in 2006 when I spent a summer on the Big Island of Hawaii. It helped me lose weight and drastically improved my self-esteem.
                                    
                                    
                                    </p>
                                    <h6>Mental & Emotional Benefits of Hiking</h6>
                                    <h4>HIKING EASES STRESS AND BOOSTS MENTAL WELLBEING</h4>
                                    <p>There’s a lot of research supporting the notion that connecting with nature improves mental health and wellbeing. Whether we are taking in the spectacular glow of a sunset or gazing out at a field of wildflowers, these brief experiences of feeling “wowed” by nature can make us feel happy and less stressed.

                                        Forest bathing is a good example. This Japanese practice involves taking a walk or hike in the woods as a way to reconnect with nature and disconnect from the digital world. Spending time in nature can evoke “a reduced sense of self-importance relative to something larger and more powerful” says Paul Piff, assistant professor of psychology and social behavior at UC Irvine. This feeling can melt away stress and elicit a more positive outlook on life.
                                        
                                        In today’s world, stress and mental illness like depression and anxiety are part of everyday life for many people. But spending time in nature can help bring us back to the present and evoke a sense of calm and peace to our otherwise hectic lives.

                                        <h4>HIKING IMPROVES MEMORY AND BRAIN FUNCTION</h4>
                                        <p>When you hike, blood flows to the brain, carrying with it oxygen and important nutrients. Studies have shown that this increased blood flow improves connections between neurons in the parts of the brain that are in charge of memory and cognitive function. Researchers found that older adults who exercised in short bursts had improved memory compared to those that didn’t.
	
                                            Often we think we’re too busy with work to go hiking. We tell ourselves that we just need to power through at our computers and cross things off our to-do list. However, the science shows that getting exercise, especially outside, can help our focus and improve our ability to process information, ultimately making our time at our computer more productive.
                                            </p>
                                            <h4>HIKING BUILDS COMMUNITY</h4>
                                            <p>Hiking is a great way to build community. Not only can it forge new friendships, but group activities provide social support and can offset feelings of doubt, worry, or fear.

                                                If you’re not sure where or how to find hiking partners, there are plenty of online resources like MeetUp.com or local Facebook groups and organizations like Women Who Hike that host group hikes and outings. Other places to look are outdoor clubs like the Sierra Club or you could even sign up for an outdoor class through REI or enroll in an outdoor education program such as NOLS or Outward Bound.
                                                
                                                If you’re craving more community in your life, giving hiking a try. It’s a great way to meet new friends and like-minded people.
                                                
                                                Hiking is a fantastic way to build strength, improve fitness, and cultivate mental health. Learn more about the physical and mental benefits of hiking.
                                                In the long run, making hiking a part of your life can improve your physical health and increase feelings of well-being, both socially and emotionally, which is a major antidote to the stressors of the modern world.
                                                
                                                As your body and mind will show you, any time spent in nature is good for the soul. While the science certainly backs it up, the best proof is how you feel at the end of a hike: a smile on your face, tired limbs, and renewed after a great day outside.
